        text-align:center;">In a world filled with technology, most of it is
      thrown out; this negatively was, is, and will continue to affect
      ecosystems and human health worldwide. My project aims to
      increase awareness about overlooked issues like these to create
      a healthier world.
    </h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
      Phones, computers, and TVs contain toxic
      substances such as lead and mercury. While these things might seem
      like another type of trash, e-waste is far more dangerous than
      it sounds. Improper disposal, especially in countries without
      strong environmental laws, can result in serious health
      risks for workers and nearby communities. Improper recycling,
      where electronics are burned or taken apart without
      safety gear, releases harmful chemicals into the air, soil, and
      water. This contamination promotes environmental
      injustice, since these acts are usually located in
      low-income areas with little political power to fight back.

      Although there are global efforts like take-back programs and
      laws promoting Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), a
      shocking 83% of global e-waste is never properly recycled. And,
      while the concept of "urban mining," which is to recover valuable
      metals like gold and copper from old electronics shows promise, it's
      still underused. One major challenge? Many people simply don't
      know where or how to recycle their electronics. Convenience,
      awareness, and access are all part of the problem. Meanwhile,
      richer countries usually ship their e-waste overseas, leaving
      poorer ones to deal with the toxicity problems. Taking over
      e-waste needs global cooperation, smarter design, and better
      education, and that starts with knowing the facts.
