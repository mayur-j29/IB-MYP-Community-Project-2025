  <p>To have my plan excecuted in an attempt to raise awareness. This was by
    hosting a school e-waste pickup, where I put up posters and informed the
    whole school with announcements representing my project. In the end, I
    collected more than 30 kgs of e-waste, thanks to the office itself and
    students. Then, I had met with a company named "eCycle Solutions." Then a
    person from that company came to pick up the e-waste. This was to make my
    school community a better place just by a little. You could hold these types
    of event at your school or workplace too! As this part of the plan went
    successful, this website is what will carry me forward in my project with it
    being a never-lasting imprint on the internet, to you guys!</p>
